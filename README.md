Project Overview :
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data using machine learning techniques. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves analyzing textual data to determine the sentiment expressed within it, such as positive, negative, or neutral.

The project utilizes a dataset of tweets collected from Twitter's API, which are labeled with sentiments (positive, negative, or neutral). Various machine learning algorithms are applied to this dataset to build and evaluate sentiment analysis models.

Features
Collects Twitter data using Twitter's API.
Preprocesses and cleans the textual data.
Extracts features from the text for machine learning models.
Implements various machine learning algorithms for sentiment analysis:
Naive Bayes Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest Classifier
Logistic Regression
Evaluates model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Provides visualizations of the results.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
Libraries:
nltk
scikit-learn
tweepy (for collecting Twitter data)
matplotlib (for visualizations)
pandas (for data manipulation)
etc. (check requirements.txt for full list)
